  <p>This is one of the most famous of the sonnets. It is referenced in the film Dead Poets Society and gave names to the band The Darling Bugs and the book and television series The Darlin Bugs of May. Read it and weep!</p>

<h4><div><span id = "first">S</span>hall I compare thee to a summer's day?</div>
<div><span id = "first">T</span>hou art more lovely and more temperate:</div>
  <div><span id = "first">R</span>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">A</span>nd summer's lease hath all too short a date;</div>
  <div><span id = "first">S</span>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">A</span>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">A</span>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">B</span>y chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</div>
  <div><span id = "first">B</span>ut they eternal summer shall not fade,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">N</span>or lose possession of that fair thou ow'st</div>
  <div><span id = "first">N</span>or shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">W</span>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">S</span>o long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</div>
  <div><span id = "first">S</span>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</div>
